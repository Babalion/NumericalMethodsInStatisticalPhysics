# Projects for the lecture Numerical Methods of Statistical Physics

The lecture was held by Markus Quandt and Giuseppe Burgio in summer term 2020 at University of TÃ¼bingen.

The used language for simulations is C++20. The IDE is CLion.

## Installation requirements

1. CMake https://cmake.org/install/
2. Armadillo http://arma.sourceforge.net/download.html
3. Matplotlib-cpp from https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp

## How to compile?

## Tests

Unit-Tests are performed with CTest. Therefore, every project has its own cpp-File with the
nomenclature: `test{projectName}.cpp` in folder `test/ctest`

## Testing different random-number-generators (RNGs)

![Diagram of Convergence](./Projects/RngTests/Genauigkeit_vs_n_1E10.png)

I did a pi-Test with 2 different random number generators (RNGs). The program can run in a fully parallelized mode.

The RNGs were used from standard C++ header `Random.h`.

We can see the convergence of the **Mersenne-Twister MT19937** algorithm with
![O(sqrt(n))](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D%28%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%29)
up to 1E10 random numbers per calculated point. Convergence doesn't seem to slow down until 1E10, so I assume we can
calculate pi more exactly with more time. The maximum period of random numbers of MT19937 is pow(2,19937)-1, so this
would be a thinkable limit.

The **linear congruential RNG** (LCG) is limited in randomness and periodicity which results in limited convergence. With
this RNG it is not possible to determine pi more exactly than to 1E-2.

## Forest Fire Simulations
There are some interesting Simulations of Forest-Fire-Cellular-Automatons:

## Sand Piles

Main idea from https://www.hiskp.uni-bonn.de/uploads/media/sandpiles.pdf.

**SandPiles** is a simple cellular-automaton where one can observe the collective behavior of falling sand on a field. The
boundary conditions are open in these implementations. You can start with a random distribution of piles of sand or
define one on your own.

The collapse condition of a sand pile is, when the max difference in height to a *von Neumann neighbour* exceeds the
specified `criticalSlope`. So different systems can be simulated.

The program outputs figures generated by https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp.
`matplotlib-cpp` depends on a python-pipe which generates plots by the `matplotlib`. I think this is the cause of the
slow generation of the images. Maybe one can accelerate the process with a c++ only plotting library or simply
generate `bmp`-files.

The final animation is produced by commandline `ffmpeg -framerate 25 -pattern_type glob -i './sandPiles/*.png' out.mp4` which
generates a `.mp4`or`.gif` from all `.png` files in the folder.

A small impression as gif with a random initial setting and always add one sand in the middle of the field.
There are more simulations, also in better quality in `./Projects/SandPiles`.

## Calculate spectral dimensions of fractal structures
Interesting literature:

https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/232136/filename/ajp-jphyslet_1983_44_1_13_0.pdf

https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF01011791.pdf

This project can calculate spectral dimensions of arbitrary fractal structures.
Each fractal structure inherits the class `WalkableGraph`.
This virtual class provides all methods needed to start a multi-core-simulation to calculate the spectral dimension.

The simulation works as follows: Multiple random walkers were spawned at a defined start-point in the `WalkableGraph`.
After that, we let the random walkers move randomly from one neighbour to another.
When a walker comes back to the start-point, we write the number of performed steps to a `.tsv`-file.

We use the mathematical theorem, that  the recurrence-probability `p_0` of a random walk on a graph should follow
for large amount of steps `n`

<code>
p_0=a*n^{d/2}
</code>

where `a` is an arbitrary constant and `d` is the searched spectral dimension.

To create a new fractal structure one has to provide a new class which inherits from `WalkableGraph`.
A constructor for the class has to be written. Furthermore, on has to add the method `hopToNeighbour(unsigned int n)`
which describes to which neighbour a walker can hop from its actual node.
The `unsigned int n` is a random number between 0 and `amountOfNeighbours` specified in the super-constructor.
The used RNG is the MT19937 from `<Random.h>`.

### Simulation results
#### 2D Euclidean lattice
In this simulation we observe 8E5 random walkers while walking on a 2D euclidean lattice.
We normalize the resulting histogram of comebacks and draw it in a loglog-scatter-plot against the number of steps.

One observes the following plot:

![Fit Euclidean 2D](./Projects/Fractals/SimulationResults/Euclidean2D.png)

The expected spectral dimension od a 2D euclidean lattice is 2. But in this simulation we observe 2.29 with a small
statistical error! This is an effect of auto-correlations. These occur because we measure not only the probability
for coming back one time from start-point to start-point, moreover we measure the probability for coming back twice,
three-times and so on. So every next measurement is influenced by its predecessors. This results in awful
auto-correlation-times and as a consequence in large systematical errors.

#### 3D Euclidean lattice
In this simulation we observe X random walkers while walking on a 3D euclidean lattice.
We normalize the resulting histogram of comebacks and draw it in a loglog-scatter-plot against the number of steps.

One observes the following plot:

![Fit Euclidean 3D](./Projects/Fractals/SimulationResults/Euclidean3D.png)

The expected spectral dimension od a 3D euclidean lattice is 3. We can observe this in our simulation because the
systematical errors due to auto-correlations aren't that high. This is a consequence of the lower comeback-rate in 3D.

#### Bethe lattice
In this simulation we observe 12.6E6 random walkers while walking on a Bethe-lattice.
A short description what a Bethe-lattice is can be read on Wikipedia.
We normalize the resulting histogram of comebacks and draw it in a semi-log-scatter-plot against the number of steps.

One observes the following plot:

![Bethe Lattice](./Projects/Fractals/SimulationResults/BetheLattice.png)

It can be stated that a Bethe-lattice does not satisfy the above law for 'normal' graphs with a power law.
On the contrary, one can see that there is an exponential dependence here with

<code>
p_0=a*\exp^{\beta n}
</code>

One can therefore conclude that the spectral dimension diverges towards infinity.
