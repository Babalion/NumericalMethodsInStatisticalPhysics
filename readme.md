# Projects for the lecture Numerical Methods of Statistical Pyhsics
The lecture was held by Markus Quandt and Giuseppe Burgio in summersemester 2020 at University of Tuebingen.

The used language for simulations is C++20. The IDE is CLion.

## Installation requirements
1. CMake https://cmake.org/install/

eventually in further releases:
  Matplotlib-cpp from https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp


## How to compile?

## Tests
Unit-Tests are performed with CTest.
Therefore every projekt has its own cpp-File with the nomenclature: `test{projectName}.cpp` in folder `test/ctest`
