# Projects for the lecture Numerical Methods of Statistical Physics

The lecture was held by Markus Quandt and Giuseppe Burgio in summer term 2020 at University of TÃ¼bingen.

The used language for simulations is C++20. The IDE is CLion.
The used build-system is Debian Buster.
It should also work on other platforms with small modifications in CMakeLists.txt.

## Testing different random-number-generators (RNGs)

![Diagram of Convergence](./Projects/RngTests/Genauigkeit_vs_n_1E10.png)

I did a pi-Test with 2 different random number generators (RNGs). The program can run in a fully parallelized mode.

The RNGs were used from standard C++ header `Random.h`.

We can see the convergence of the **Mersenne-Twister MT19937** algorithm with
up to 1E10 random numbers per calculated point. Convergence doesn't seem to slow down until 1E10, so I assume we can
calculate pi more exactly with more time. The maximum period of random numbers of MT19937 is pow(2,19937)-1, so this
would be a thinkable limit.

The **linear congruential RNG** (LCG) is limited in randomness and periodicity which results in limited convergence. With
this RNG it is not possible to determine pi more exactly than up to 1E-2.

## Ising Model
### 2 Level System
This project is available under: https://github.com/Babalion/Ising2level

### Sigma-Model
This is an Ising-Spin-System on a square lattice where every spin can direct in an arbitrary angle in 2D.
One can thus parametrize each spin via angle `theta`. You can also view the simulation live via openCV. Example below:
